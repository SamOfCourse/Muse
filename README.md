This is an Android application geared towards providing novice pianists with the tools needed to learn and grow.

The idea was to create a piece of software that provided the basics for someone to learn how to play sheet music on the piano. This includes a metronome, and a way for the user to identify the notes in a piece of music they wanted to play.To achieve this we tweaked an existing image processing library that creates a MusicXML document from sheet music. We then re-drew the music using that XML and overlayed the notes and symbols with buttons that provide descriptions for the element.

To use this file with Android Studio, you unzip the file first. 
Select the option to open a project. In the explorer, select the project (Project will appear with robot head as icon).

Project should automatically build. If you have no emulators, create one using the Android 9.0 Pie x86 operating system, preferably the Pixel 4 XL due to its large screen.
