CSCD 488/490 Team 5 Senior Project

To use this file with Android Studio, you unzip the file first. 
Select the option to open a project. In the explorer, select the project (Project will appear with robot head as icon).

Project should automatically build. If you have no emulators, create one using the Android 9.0 Pie x86 operating system, preferably the Pixel 4 XL due to its large screen.
